##  Document purpose
I will try briefly to explain how I wanted to approach testing, which difficulties I faced and what I actually was able to produce.

## Initial technical task:
As a user making an online photobook I should be able to save it
Steps
  1. Open https://bonusprint.co.uk
  2. Choose to Create new online photobook
  3. Save photobook with a name

## Plan was:
1. Write tests in Java.
2. Use Selenide library for tests
3. Use TestNg as test runner.
4. Write positive test for saving photobook

## Difficulties I have faced during testing : 
Big amount pop ups and iframes put some difficulties into writing progress. Had to spend some time on investigation of a user journey 

## What could be improved : 
- Can be added CI and reporting.
